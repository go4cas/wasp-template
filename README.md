# ![WASP Logog](/assets/wasp-small.jpg) WASP
> Windi.css, Alpine.js, Spruce & Presto

WASP is a boilerplate aiming at starting front-end applications with speed and ease

## Component Structure
WASP implements a generic component stucture, allowing for multiple levels of nested components.

Each component could include some, or all, of the following:
* Markup: using standard html, sprinkled with Presto magic, and windi.css for styling - `index.pres`
* Component Logic: using alpine.js to build simple or complex compoenent logic - `index.js`
* State: using Spruce to store component state in a creantralized application store - `store.js`

In order to fully understand how the components will be extracted, nested, bundled, etc., please review the [Presto README](https://github.com/stephancasas/presto).

To get you started, we have included a few basic sample components. Have a look at the markup, logic and state, to understand how all the components work together.

The folder structure for components is very simple:
```
|_ src
  |_ components
    |_ my_component
    |  |_ index.pres
    |  |_ index.js
    |  |_ store.js
    |_ my_other_component
    |  |_ index.pres
    |  |_ index.js
    |  |_ store.js
    |  |_ my_sub_component
    |  |  |_ index.pres
    |  |  |_ index.js
    |  |  |_ store.js
```

The main `src` folder contains a few important files:
* `index.pres` - this is the main application single page file, and the starting point for Presto
* `index.htnml` - this file will be auto-generated by Presto, and used by Vite to run through the application dependancies, and generate your bundles. *DO NOT MANUALLY CHANGE THIS FILE!*
* `style.css` - add any aditional application specific styles to this files - that is if Windi/Tailwind is not enough
* `index.js` - this is you application main logic file, and is used by Vite to run through your javascript dependancies, modules, etc
* `utils.js` - general utilities to build component structre, import state into the app store, etc
* `/plugins` - add your Alpine.js magic properties in here

### Configuration
All config files reside in the project root. For now, the only imprtant mentions are:
* `presto.config.js` - The standard Presto config file. The only difference to "normal" Presto apps is the use of `index.pres`, which gerenates into `index.html`
* `vite.config.js` - Standard Vite config, including the Windi.css plugin. Add any additional Vite and/or Rollup plugins in here

## What is included?

* [Windi.css](), a tailwind.css compatible library, for component styling
* [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) for reactivity and component logic
* [Spruce](https://github.com/ryangjchandler/spruce) for application and component state management
* [Presto](https://github.com/stephancasas/presto) for component markup bunlding
* [Alpine Magic Helpers](https://github.com/alpine-collective/alpine-magic-helpers) for additinal sugar
* [Vite](http://vitejs.dev/) for dev server, with hot reload, and production-ready application bundling
